## Julian presented his & Dr.McGee's AI LLM Research & his created Poster: “From Prompts to Patterns: Exploring AI Responses with Text Analytics.” Faculty mentor: Monnie McGee, Statistics and Data Science”. 


Julian has worked throughout the year on this Research Project, which will soon be **published in a journal**, and he will be **co-authored**. His research with Dr. McGee, “From Prompts to Patterns: Exploring AI Responses with Text Analytics” aims to uncover socioeconomic inequality in AI Access for Student Learning by comparing several free and paid LLMs/AI’s (OpenAI, Grok, Claude & Gemini) response accuracy and conciseness when being asked to compute Statistics/Math Exam questions. (Refer to Poster at bottom for more details).


## Julian stood out to judges by creating and implementing a LLM Statistics Comparator Web App on his Poster in a QR Code that leveraged Python, Flask, and React to use API Keys to compare LLMs on one Landing Page. Web App may or may not run globally due to the expiration of the API Keys (Cost of Web servicing) since the website cost was funded by the school for a temporary period.
